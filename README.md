# Project Template Repository
This repository is designed to serve as a template for the curation and maintenance of data within a specific project. Projects may either be a thesis chapter or a manuscript publication. 

## Project structure
All project repos are named according to the associated grant and labelled with a short informative tag for the project (e.g. grant_projectname'). In addition, they contain the following folders:

1. **data |** will contain separate folders for raw, cleaned, and processed data, as well as data from databases incorporated as submodules. For more information related to reading in and using submodules, see `UsingSubmodules.md`.
2. **code |** R scripts for processing and analyzing project information
3. **bin |** R scripts containing outside derived code
4. **src |** R scripts containing user derived code
5. **docs |** project notes, etc.
6. **Figs_Tables |** saved figures and tables from analysis

All databases should also contain a **README.md** file which details the following information:

1. Project title
2. Lead HQP
3. Other HQP
4. Lead PI
5. Other PI
6. Data sources
7. Funding sources

See `project_template-README.md` for an example of the information required in a project repository.
